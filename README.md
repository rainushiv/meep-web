Developed a lightweight, self-hosted social media platform with React.js front-end and a Hono + Bun backend,  
featuring real-time chat, advanced search, and secure deployment. Designed for responsive user interaction and  
scalable data handling.

##  Live Demo
 [Live Site](https://shivalry.dev)  

> **Note:** The live demo does not include Elasticsearch because the container is too resource-intensive for the Hetzner server.
If youâ€™d like to see it in action, check out the demo video below. Also, I did not focus too much on the frontend so if your screen is considerably larger or smaller the UI will not look correct.

##  Live video (Elasticsearch/websocket)

The reason you don't see avatars in the searchbar is due to there being 10k+ users in the databse and all the images are stored in an s3 bucket. s3 only allows for 2k put requests
before they begin charging so i opted out of putting avatars for the 10k users.
